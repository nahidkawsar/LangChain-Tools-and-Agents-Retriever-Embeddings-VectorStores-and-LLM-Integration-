# LangChain Tools and Agents: Retriever, Embeddings, VectorStores, and LLM Integration"  

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to set up **Tools and Agents** using LangChain and related libraries manually.  

## Setup Instructions  

Follow these steps to set up your environment and run the project.  

### Step 1: Download the Files  

1. Download the provided files:  
   - `tools-and-agents.ipynb`  
   - `requirements.txt`  
   - `.env`  

2. Place all files in a single folder on your machine. For example:  
   ```
   tools-and-agents/
   ├── tools-and-agents.ipynb
   ├── requirements.txt
   ├── .env
   ```  

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment  

1. Open a terminal in the folder where the files are located.  
2. Create a virtual environment by running the following command:  

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```  

3. Activate the virtual environment:  
   - On **Windows**:  
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```  
   - On **macOS/Linux**:  
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```  

### Step 3: Install Dependencies  

1. Ensure `pip` is updated:  
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```  
2. Install the required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

### Step 4: Set Up the Environment Variables  

1. Open the `.env` file using any text editor.  
2. Add your API keys and tokens in the following format:  

   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
   ```  

   Save the file after editing.  

### Step 5: Run the Jupyter Notebook  

1. Install Jupyter Notebook if you don’t have it already:  
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```  
2. Launch the notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```  
3. Open `tools-and-agents.ipynb` in the Jupyter Notebook interface.  
4. Run each code cell sequentially to test and implement the functionality.  

### Additional Notes  

- **Document Splitting**: Customize the splitting methods (`CharacterTextSplitter`, `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`) based on the use case.  
- **VectorStores**: Save, edit, or retrieve vectors as required using FAISS or ChromaDB.  
- **Agents**: Use the provided tools and models for various retrieval and interaction tasks.

## Requirements  

Make sure the `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary dependencies. The basic structure might look like:  

```
langchain
python-dotenv
faiss-cpu
bs4
arxiv
jupyter
```

## FAQs  

1. **Why create a virtual environment?**  
   A virtual environment isolates project dependencies to avoid conflicts with global Python packages.  

2. **What API keys are required?**  
   - **GROQ_API_KEY**: For the Groq model.  
   - **HF_TOKEN**: For HuggingFace embeddings.  

3. **How to add more tools?**  
   Extend the `tools` list in the notebook by creating new retrievers, LLM tools, or document loaders.
